# AI Agent System: Design Decisions and Clarifications

## 1. Agent Communication Protocol

### Question 1.1: Message Routing Strategy
Select the primary strategy for routing messages between agents:

A) **Centralized Router**
- All messages go through a central routing service
- Easier to monitor and secure
- Potential bottleneck
- Simpler to implement

B) **Direct P2P Communication**
- Agents communicate directly when in same security context
- Better performance
- More complex security implementation
- Higher complexity

C) **Hybrid Approach**
- Critical messages through central router
- Performance-sensitive messages direct
- Best balance but most complex
- Requires clear routing rules

### Question 1.2: State Synchronization
Choose the approach for maintaining state across agents:

A) **Event Sourcing**
- All state changes as events
- Complete audit trail
- Higher storage requirements
- Complex to implement

B) **Shared State Store**
- Redis-based shared state
- Simple to implement
- Potential consistency issues
- Lower latency

C) **Local State with Sync**
- Agents maintain local state
- Periodic synchronization
- Better performance
- More complex conflict resolution

## 2. Security Implementation

### Question 2.1: Sandbox Isolation Level
Select the level of sandbox isolation:

A) **Process-Level**
- Each function in separate process
- Medium security
- Lower resource overhead
- Faster startup

B) **Container-Level**
- Each agent in separate container
- High security
- Higher resource usage
- Slower startup

C) **VM-Level**
- Each agent in separate VM
- Maximum security
- Highest resource usage
- Slowest startup

### Question 2.2: File System Access Strategy
Choose how to handle file system access:

A) **Copy-on-Access**
- Copy files into sandbox when needed
- Most secure
- Higher disk usage
- Slower for large files

B) **Bind Mounts**
- Direct mounting of directories
- Better performance
- Less secure
- Simpler implementation

C) **Virtual File System**
- Custom VFS implementation
- Fine-grained control
- Most complex
- Best security/performance balance

## 3. State Management

### Question 3.1: Persistence Strategy
Select how to persist agent state:

A) **Document Store**
- MongoDB for state storage
- Flexible schema
- Easy to modify
- Eventually consistent

B) **Relational Database**
- PostgreSQL for state storage
- ACID compliance
- Rigid schema
- Better data integrity

C) **Hybrid Storage**
- Hot data in Redis
- Cold data in PostgreSQL
- Best performance
- Most complex

### Question 3.2: Conflict Resolution
Choose how to handle state conflicts:

A) **Last Write Wins**
- Simple timestamp-based resolution
- Potential data loss
- Easy to implement
- Good for simple data

B) **CRDT-Based**
- Conflict-free replicated data types
- No data loss
- Complex implementation
- Higher memory usage

C) **Custom Merge Strategy**
- Domain-specific resolution rules
- Best data accuracy
- Most complex
- Requires clear business rules

## 4. Performance Optimization

### Question 4.1: Agent Pooling Strategy
Select how to manage agent instances:

A) **Static Pool**
- Fixed number of agents
- Predictable resource usage
- Simpler implementation
- Potential capacity issues

B) **Dynamic Scaling**
- Scale based on demand
- Better resource utilization
- More complex
- Requires scaling rules

C) **Hybrid Pool**
- Base static pool
- Dynamic overflow
- Best balance
- Medium complexity

### Question 4.2: Task Distribution
Choose how to distribute tasks across agents:

A) **Round Robin**
- Simple distribution
- Equal load
- No specialization
- Easiest to implement

B) **Capability-Based**
- Match tasks to agent capabilities
- Better specialization
- More complex routing
- Requires capability tracking

C) **Load-Based**
- Consider current agent load
- Best performance
- Most complex
- Requires load monitoring
